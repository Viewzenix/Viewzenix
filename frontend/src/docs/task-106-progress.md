# TASK-106 Progress Report: WebhookService Backend Integration

## Current Status

The preparatory work for integrating the WebhookService with the backend API has been completed. This work is on the `feature/webhook-service-integration` branch.

## Accomplished Tasks

1. **API Client Implementation**
   - Created a robust API client in `src/services/api.ts` for making HTTP requests to the backend
   - Implemented error handling and standardized response processing
   - Created typed methods for all webhook operations (CRUD)

2. **WebhookService Updates**
   - Modified `src/services/webhook.service.ts` to support both API and localStorage
   - Implemented fallback mechanism when API is unavailable
   - Maintained backward compatibility with the existing interface

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Added `.env.local.example` with settings for API URL and feature flags
   - Documented the environment variables in the API integration guide

4. **Mock API Implementation**
   - Set up Mock Service Worker (MSW) v2 for simulating the backend API
   - Created mock handlers for all webhook endpoints
   - Configured automatic mock server initialization in development

5. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive API integration documentation in `src/docs/api-integration.md`
   - Added examples for using the API client and WebhookService
   - Included troubleshooting guidance and future improvements

## Remaining Tasks (Blocked by TASK-008)

1. **API Endpoint Verification**
   - Once TASK-008 is completed, verify that our API client's endpoints match the actual backend implementation
   - Update endpoint paths as needed to match the backend

2. **Authentication Implementation**
   - Implement any authentication requirements for the backend API
   - Update the API client to include authentication tokens

3. **Data Model Validation**
   - Ensure the webhook data models match the backend expectations
   - Update TypeScript interfaces if needed

4. **Error Handling Refinement**
   - Refine error handling based on actual backend error responses
   - Implement specific handlers for different error types

5. **Integration Testing**
   - Test the WebhookService with the actual backend
   - Verify all CRUD operations work correctly
   - Test error scenarios and edge cases

## Next Steps

1. Wait for TASK-008 to be completed by the backend team
2. Once TASK-008 is done, review the backend implementation and update our code as needed
3. Test the integration thoroughly
4. Complete the implementation of TASK-106
5. Create a pull request to merge the feature branch to the main branch

## Notes

- All code has been written with TypeScript and follows the project's coding standards
- The mock server allows development to continue without the backend being ready
- The implementation supports graceful fallback to localStorage when the API is unavailable
- Environment configuration allows easy switching between API and localStorage
