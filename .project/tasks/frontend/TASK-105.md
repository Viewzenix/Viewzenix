# Implement Webhook Configuration Form and Management UI

## Description
Design and implement the webhook configuration form component and enhance the webhook-setup page with management functionality for creating, editing, and deleting webhook configurations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create WebhookConfigForm component with fields for:
  - Webhook name/description
  - Security token/passphrase
  - Notification preferences
- [x] Implement form validation with appropriate error messages
- [x] Create submit functionality with loading, success, and error states
- [x] Add reusable form components in common directory
- [x] Implement TypeScript types for webhook configuration data
- [x] Create mock WebhookService for simulating API interactions
- [x] Enhance the webhook-setup page with instructions and webhook management functionality
- [x] Implement responsive design that works on all screen sizes

## Technical Details
The webhook configuration form was implemented using React Hook Form for form handling and validation. The component includes:

- Comprehensive validation rules for all fields
- Async submission handling with appropriate loading states
- Clear success/error feedback
- Token generation functionality
- Support for both creation and editing modes

Reusable form components created:
- FormInput
- FormTextarea 
- FormCheckbox
- Button (with loading state)
- StatusMessage

The webhook setup page includes:
- Instructions for using webhooks with TradingView
- Security best practices
- Example webhook JSON configuration
- List of existing webhooks with management options
- Toggle to show/hide the form

## Dependencies
- TASK-101: Layout component and basic page structure

## Notes
React Hook Form was chosen over Formik for its better performance and simpler API. The mock WebhookService includes simulated API delays to provide a realistic user experience during development.
