# Create main App layout component with a persistent sidebar for navigation

## Description
Design and implement the main application layout component that includes a persistent sidebar for navigation. This layout will serve as the container for all pages in the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create a responsive layout component that works on both desktop and tablet viewports
- [x] Implement a persistent sidebar on the left side of the layout
- [x] The sidebar should have a logo/branding area at the top
- [x] The sidebar should have a navigation area for menu items
- [x] The layout should include a main content area that takes up the rest of the screen
- [x] Implement proper styling using CSS modules or styled components
- [x] Add appropriate prop types and documentation

## Technical Details
The layout should be implemented as a reusable React component:

```tsx
// Layout.tsx
import React, { ReactNode } from 'react';
import styles from './Layout.module.css';

interface LayoutProps {
  children: ReactNode;
}

export function Layout({ children }: LayoutProps) {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <aside className={styles.sidebar}>
        <div className={styles.logo}>
          {/* Logo/branding goes here */}
          <h1>Viewzenix</h1>
        </div>
        <nav className={styles.navigation}>
          {/* Navigation will be added in TASK-104 */}
        </nav>
      </aside>
      <main className={styles.content}>
        {children}
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Use a modern, clean design with a color scheme appropriate for a financial/trading application.

## Dependencies
None

## Notes
This is a foundational component for the UI, so focus on creating a clean, maintainable structure. The actual navigation links will be added in a subsequent task (TASK-104).

## Updates
- **2024-05-08**: Task created 
- **2024-05-10**: Task completed. Implemented AppLayout component with responsive sidebar that collapses on smaller screens. Navigation links for all main sections included with active state styling. Used Next.js 14 with App Router and TypeScript.
