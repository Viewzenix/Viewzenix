# TASK-109: Fix Server-Side Rendering Compatibility in WebhookService

## Priority
Medium

## Type
Bug Fix

## Status
Todo

## Description
During application startup, an error occurs in the server console: `Error loading webhooks from localStorage: ReferenceError: localStorage is not defined`. This happens because the WebhookService attempts to access the `localStorage` API during server-side rendering (SSR), but this browser-specific API is not available in the Node.js environment where SSR occurs.

While this error doesn't prevent the application from functioning correctly on the client side (after hydration), it causes errors during SSR and could potentially affect performance and SEO.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Modify WebhookService to detect server-side rendering environment
- [ ] Conditionally access localStorage only in browser environments
- [ ] Ensure the service initializes properly during SSR without errors
- [ ] Maintain all existing functionality after the fix
- [ ] Add unit tests to verify SSR compatibility
- [ ] Document SSR considerations in the service

## Technical Details
Several approaches can be used to fix this issue:
1. Check for the presence of the `window` object before accessing `localStorage`
2. Move localStorage initialization to a `useEffect` hook when used in components
3. Use dynamic imports to load the service only on the client side
4. Implement a server-safe storage fallback

The error occurs specifically in `webhook.service.ts` in the `loadFromStorage` method called during service initialization.
