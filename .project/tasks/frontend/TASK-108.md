# TASK-108: Fix React Rendering Errors in Webhook Setup Page

## Priority
Medium

## Type
Bug Fix

## Status
Todo

## Description
During manual testing of the webhook management functionality, we discovered several React rendering errors in the developer console. While these errors don't completely block functionality (changes are visible after page refresh), they indicate issues with component lifecycle management and state updates that should be addressed to improve code quality and user experience.

The specific errors include:
1. `Warning: Cannot update a component ('HotReload') while rendering a different component ('WebhookSetupPage')`
2. `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')` at page.tsx:64

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Fix setState calls during render phase in WebhookSetupPage component
- [ ] Add proper null/undefined checks for webhook objects before accessing their properties
- [ ] Ensure all webhook operations (create, edit, delete) work without console errors
- [ ] Verify changes are immediately visible without requiring page refresh
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for edge cases

## Technical Details
The error about updating a component during the render phase of another component suggests that useState or setState is being called directly in the render function or in a function called during render. This violates React's rules about when state updates can occur.

The "Cannot read properties of undefined" error indicates that the code is trying to access properties of an object that doesn't exist yet, likely due to asynchronous data loading or state management issues.

The affected file is primarily the webhook setup page component (page.tsx, around line 64).
