# Implement Order Engine service

## Description
Create an Order Engine service that processes normalized trades into orders ready for submission to brokers, with support for different position sizing strategies and simulation mode.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create data models for orders with proper typing
- [x] Implement order sizing strategies (fixed, percentage, risk-based)
- [x] Create order objects from trade data
- [x] Implement simulation mode for testing without placing real orders
- [x] Add comprehensive logging throughout the process
- [x] Create unit tests for the Order Engine

## Implementation Notes
- Created `app/core/models/order.py` with data models for orders
- Implemented `app/core/services/order_engine.py` with the Order Engine service
- Added multiple position sizing strategies
- Implemented simulation mode that logs orders without submitting them
- Added unit tests in `tests/unit/test_order_engine.py`
