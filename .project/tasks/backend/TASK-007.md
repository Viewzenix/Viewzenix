# TASK-007: Implement webhook history tracking

**Priority:** High
**Type:** Feature
**Assignee:** @backend-agent
**Status:** Todo

## Description

Implement a system for tracking webhook history, storing received webhooks, processing results, and providing an API endpoint to query this history. This will enable users to monitor webhook activity and troubleshoot issues.

## Context

The backend currently processes webhooks but doesn't store any history of received webhooks or their processing results. Adding history tracking will provide valuable information for users and enable monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a database model for webhook history records
- [ ] Update the webhook endpoint to store incoming webhook data
- [ ] Record processing results (success/failure, order details if applicable)
- [ ] Implement an API endpoint to query webhook history
- [ ] Add filtering capabilities (by date range, status, ticker)
- [ ] Include pagination for history results
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data is properly handled (redacted in logs, secured in storage)

## Dependencies

- Backend webhook endpoint implementation (TASK-002) - Completed
- Backend order processing implementation (TASK-006) - Completed

## Resources

- Current webhook endpoint implementation
- Order processing service implementation

## Notes

- Consider using SQLAlchemy for the database model
- Implement proper indexing for efficient queries
- Store enough information for troubleshooting but be mindful of storage requirements
- Consider adding a cleanup/archiving mechanism for old records
