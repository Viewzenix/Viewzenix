# Migrate Backend to Supabase and Implement Webhook Signal Processing

## Description
Migrate the backend database and authentication to Supabase while maintaining a lightweight Flask API server specifically for processing incoming webhook signals. This approach streamlines our architecture while maintaining proper separation of concerns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] WebhookConfig table is properly defined in Supabase with UUID primary keys
- [ ] Row-level security is implemented for data protection
- [ ] Webhook signal processing endpoint works correctly
- [ ] Integration with broker APIs is implemented or properly mocked
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect Supabase integration

## Technical Details
The migration will involve:
1. Creating a database schema in Supabase with proper tables for webhook configurations
2. Setting up row-level security policies for data protection
3. Implementing edge functions or serverless functions for webhook processing
4. Updating the Flask backend to use Supabase client for data access
5. Implementing proper error handling and logging
6. Connecting webhook signals to broker API calls
7. Testing the full integration flow

Research is required on:
- Edge functions in Supabase for serverless webhook processing
- Supabase PostgreSQL row-level security (RLS) policies for data protection
- Best practices for connecting Flask APIs with Supabase

## Dependencies
- TASK-110: Update Backend Controllers for SQLite Compatibility (This task ensured our code was ready to work with different database types)

## Notes
This migration is based on findings from manual testing that highlighted integration gaps between the frontend and backend. Supabase provides an excellent opportunity to solve this with minimal infrastructure overhead while maintaining professional code quality.

The MCP-Hub tools for Supabase will be used for database management, SQL execution, and edge function deployment.
