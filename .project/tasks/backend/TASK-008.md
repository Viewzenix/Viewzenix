# Implement Webhook Configuration Management Endpoints

## Description
Implement RESTful API endpoints for webhook configuration management to support the frontend WebhookService. These endpoints will allow for creating, reading, updating, and deleting webhook configurations through the API.

## Context
The frontend has implemented a WebhookService with methods for CRUD operations on webhook configurations, but the backend currently only has an endpoint for receiving webhook signals. This task involves creating the missing endpoints to manage webhook configurations in the backend, which is required before the frontend WebhookService can be integrated with the backend API (TASK-106).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement data model for WebhookConfig
- [ ] Create database migrations for webhook configuration storage
- [ ] Implement the following RESTful endpoints:
  - GET /webhooks - List all webhook configurations
  - GET /webhooks/{id} - Get a specific webhook configuration
  - POST /webhooks - Create a new webhook configuration
  - PUT /webhooks/{id} - Update a webhook configuration
  - DELETE /webhooks/{id} - Delete a webhook configuration
- [ ] Implement validation for all endpoint inputs
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling and responses
- [ ] Add proper authentication and authorization
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging
- [ ] Write unit tests for all endpoints
- [ ] Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger annotations

## WebhookConfig Model Requirements
The model should include at minimum these fields, matching the frontend's WebhookConfig type:
- id: Unique identifier
- name: User-friendly name for the webhook
- description: Description of the webhook's purpose
- webhookUrl: Endpoint URL to be provided to TradingView
- securityToken: Security token/passphrase for webhook authentication
- notificationPreferences: JSON object with notification settings
- isActive: Whether this webhook is active
- createdAt: Creation timestamp
- updatedAt: Last update timestamp

## Technical Details
- Use Flask Blueprints for organizing the endpoints
- Use SQLAlchemy for database access
- Implement proper schema validation for request/response data
- Ensure endpoints follow REST principles
- Use JSON for all request/response bodies
- Include appropriate HTTP status codes and error responses

## Dependencies
- TASK-006: Enhance webhook endpoint to use order processing services (completed)
