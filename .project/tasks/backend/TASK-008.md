# Implement Webhook Configuration Management Endpoints

## Description
Implement RESTful API endpoints for webhook configuration management to support the frontend WebhookService. These endpoints will allow for creating, reading, updating, and deleting webhook configurations through the API.

## Context
The frontend has implemented a WebhookService with methods for CRUD operations on webhook configurations, but the backend currently only has an endpoint for receiving webhook signals. This task involves creating the missing endpoints to manage webhook configurations in the backend, which is required before the frontend WebhookService can be integrated with the backend API (TASK-106).

## Requirements
- Create a WebhookConfig data model using SQLAlchemy
- Implement database migrations for the webhook configuration table
- Create a new Flask Blueprint for webhook configuration management
- Implement the following RESTful endpoints:
  - GET /webhooks - List all webhook configurations
  - GET /webhooks/{id} - Get a specific webhook configuration
  - POST /webhooks - Create a new webhook configuration
  - PUT /webhooks/{id} - Update a webhook configuration
  - DELETE /webhooks/{id} - Delete a webhook configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement data model for WebhookConfig
- [x] Create database migrations for webhook configuration storage
- [x] Implement all required RESTful endpoints
- [x] Add validation for all endpoint inputs
- [x] Ensure proper error handling and responses
- [x] Add comprehensive logging
- [x] Write unit tests for all endpoints
- [x] Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger annotations
- [ ] Add proper authentication and authorization (to be implemented in a future task)

## WebhookConfig Model Requirements
The model should include at minimum these fields, matching the frontend's WebhookConfig type:
- id: Unique identifier
- name: User-friendly name for the webhook
- description: Description of the webhook's purpose
- webhookUrl: Endpoint URL to be provided to TradingView
- securityToken: Security token/passphrase for webhook authentication
- notificationPreferences: JSON object with notification settings
- isActive: Whether this webhook is active
- createdAt: Creation timestamp
- updatedAt: Last update timestamp

## Technical Details
- Use Flask Blueprints for organizing the endpoints
- Use SQLAlchemy for database access
- Implement proper schema validation for request/response data
- Ensure endpoints follow REST principles
- Use JSON for all request/response bodies
- Include appropriate HTTP status codes and error responses

## Dependencies
- TASK-006: Enhance webhook endpoint to use order processing services (completed)

## Related
- TASK-106: Update WebhookService to integrate with backend API

## Resources
- [Frontend WebhookService implementation](../../frontend/src/services/webhook.service.ts)
- [Frontend webhook types](../../frontend/src/types/webhook.ts)
- [Existing webhook endpoint](../../backend/app/api/routes/webhook.py)
- Manual testing report with architectural gap documentation

## Implementation Notes
- Added Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate for database management
- Created WebhookConfig model with fields matching the frontend type
- Implemented all CRUD endpoints with proper validation and error handling
- Added comprehensive tests for all endpoints and error cases
- Created OpenAPI documentation for the API
- Created a detailed API specification document for frontend integration
- Updated the app to initialize the database and register the new blueprint

## Testing Instructions
1. Run the unit tests with `pytest -xvs tests/unit/test_webhook_config_endpoints.py`
2. Initialize the database with `flask init-db`
3. Seed the database with `flask seed-db`
4. Start the server and test the endpoints manually with Postman or curl
- Add validation for all endpoint inputs
- Implement proper error handling and responses
- Add authentication and authorization (to be implemented in a future task)
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Write unit tests for all endpoints
- Document the API with OpenAPI/Swagger annotations

## Acceptance Criteria
- All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, etc.)
- Input validation catches malformed requests
- The API follows RESTful principles
- All CRUD operations work correctly
- The model schema matches the frontend WebhookConfig type
- Unit tests cover all endpoints and error cases
- API documentation is complete and accurate

## Dependencies
- TASK-002: Define `/webhook` route in a Flask Blueprint
