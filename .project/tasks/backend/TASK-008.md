# TASK-008: Implement Webhook Configuration Management Endpoints

## Priority
High

## Type
Feature

## Status
Todo

## Description
The frontend WebhookService has been implemented with methods for CRUD operations on webhook configurations, but the backend currently only has an endpoint for receiving trading signals. This architectural gap prevents proper integration between the frontend and backend for webhook management.

We need to implement a complete set of RESTful endpoints for managing webhook configurations to allow users to create, retrieve, update, and delete webhook configurations through the UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement GET /webhooks endpoint to list all webhook configurations
- [ ] Implement GET /webhooks/{id} endpoint to get a specific webhook configuration
- [ ] Implement POST /webhooks endpoint to create a new webhook configuration
- [ ] Implement PUT /webhooks/{id} endpoint to update a webhook configuration
- [ ] Implement DELETE /webhooks/{id} endpoint to delete a webhook configuration
- [ ] Add appropriate validation for all endpoints
- [ ] Include proper error handling and response formatting
- [ ] Create database models for webhook configurations
- [ ] Add authentication/authorization for these endpoints
- [ ] Document the API endpoints using OpenAPI/Swagger

## Technical Details
The endpoints should follow the API response format expected by the frontend:

```json
// Success response format
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Optional success message",
  "data": { /* Response data */ }
}

// Error response format
{
  "status": "error",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "message": "Error message",
  "details": { /* Optional error details */ }
}
```

The webhook configuration model should include at minimum:
- id
- name
- description
- webhook_url
- security_token
- notification_preferences
- is_active
- created_at
- updated_at
