# Implement Webhook Configuration Management Endpoints

## Description
Create RESTful API endpoints for managing webhook configurations. These endpoints will allow the frontend to create, read, update, and delete webhook configurations, enabling full integration between the frontend and backend systems.

## Context
The frontend has a WebhookService that expects to interact with CRUD endpoints for webhook configurations, but the backend currently only has an endpoint for receiving webhook signals.

## Requirements
- Create a WebhookConfig data model using SQLAlchemy
- Implement database migrations for the webhook configuration table
- Create a new Flask Blueprint for webhook configuration management
- Implement the following RESTful endpoints:
  - GET /webhooks - List all webhook configurations
  - GET /webhooks/{id} - Get a specific webhook configuration
  - POST /webhooks - Create a new webhook configuration
  - PUT /webhooks/{id} - Update a webhook configuration
  - DELETE /webhooks/{id} - Delete a webhook configuration
- Add validation for all endpoint inputs
- Implement proper error handling and responses
- Add authentication and authorization (to be implemented in a future task)
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Write unit tests for all endpoints
- Document the API with OpenAPI/Swagger annotations

## Acceptance Criteria
- All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, etc.)
- Input validation catches malformed requests
- The API follows RESTful principles
- All CRUD operations work correctly
- The model schema matches the frontend WebhookConfig type
- Unit tests cover all endpoints and error cases
- API documentation is complete and accurate

## Dependencies
- TASK-002: Define `/webhook` route in a Flask Blueprint

## Related
- TASK-106: Update WebhookService to integrate with backend API

## Implementation Notes
- Added Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate for database management
- Created WebhookConfig model with fields matching the frontend type
- Implemented all CRUD endpoints with proper validation and error handling
- Added comprehensive tests for all endpoints and error cases
- Created OpenAPI documentation for the API
- Created a detailed API specification document for frontend integration
- Updated the app to initialize the database and register the new blueprint

## Review Checklist
- [x] All required endpoints are implemented
- [x] Input validation is comprehensive
- [x] Error handling follows established patterns
- [x] Tests cover happy paths and error cases
- [x] Code follows project coding standards
- [x] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [x] Implementation matches frontend requirements

## Testing Instructions
1. Run the unit tests with `pytest -xvs tests/unit/test_webhook_config_endpoints.py`
2. Initialize the database with `flask init-db`
3. Seed the database with `flask seed-db`
4. Start the server and test the endpoints manually with Postman or curl
