# Set up basic Flask application structure

## Description
Create the initial Flask application structure for the trading webhook platform including folder organization, basic configuration, and application factory pattern.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Project follows the recommended Flask application factory pattern
- [x] Directory structure includes separate folders for routes/blueprints, models, services, and utilities
- [x] Basic configuration is implemented (development, testing, production environments)
- [x] Requirements.txt file with all necessary dependencies
- [x] Basic application entry point (app.py or similar)
- [x] Simple test harness to verify application setup

## Technical Details
The application should follow a modular structure to allow for clean separation of concerns:

```
backend/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── __init__.py         # App factory
  │   ├── config.py           # Configuration
  │   ├── routes/             # API endpoints
  │   ├── models/             # Data models
  │   ├── services/           # Business logic
  │   └── utils/              # Helper functions
  ├── tests/                  # Test cases
  ├── requirements.txt        # Dependencies
  └── app.py                  # Entry point
```

The app factory pattern should be used to create the Flask application, allowing for different configurations (dev/test/prod) to be easily applied.

## Dependencies
None

## Notes
This is the foundation for all subsequent backend tasks, so focus on a clean, scalable architecture that allows for easy extension.

## Updates
- **2024-05-08**: Task created
- **2024-05-10**: Task completed - Implemented Flask application factory pattern with proper directory structure, configuration classes, and logging setup
