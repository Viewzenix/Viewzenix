# Basic UI Navigation

## Description
**As a** User (Trader)
**I want to** navigate between the main sections of the application (Webhook Setup, Brokers, Bots, Logs, Analytics)
**So that** I can access different functionalities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A persistent navigation element (e.g., sidebar, top tabs) is present
- [ ] Navigation links/buttons exist for "Webhook Setup", "Brokers", "Bots", "Logs", "Analytics"
- [ ] Clicking a navigation link displays the corresponding page/section content
- [ ] The currently active section is visually indicated in the navigation

## Technical Notes
The navigation should be implemented as a React component that maintains state for the currently active section. The component should be responsive and adapt well to both desktop and tablet viewports. Initially, the page content can be simple placeholders, with the focus on establishing the navigation structure.
