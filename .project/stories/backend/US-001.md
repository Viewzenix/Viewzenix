# Receive TradingView Webhook

## Description
**As a** System
**I want to** securely receive POST requests on the `/webhook` endpoint
**So that** TradingView alerts can be ingested.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A Flask route exists for `/webhook` accepting POST requests
- [ ] The endpoint returns HTTP 200 upon successful receipt (initially, even without full processing)
- [ ] Basic logging (to console or file) indicates when a request is received
- [ ] (Future consideration: Implement HMAC validation if required by spec)

## Technical Notes
The webhook endpoint should be implemented using Flask blueprints for better organization. The route should be properly secured and include basic request validation before further processing. Initially, the main focus is on establishing the endpoint and ensuring it can receive and acknowledge webhooks.
