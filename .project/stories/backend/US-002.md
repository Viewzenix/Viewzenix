# Process Trading Orders

## Description
**As a** System
**I want to** process webhooks into standardized orders and submit them to brokers
**So that** trading signals can be executed automatically.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Incoming webhooks are classified and normalized into Trade objects
- [x] Trades are processed into Orders with proper sizing
- [x] Orders are submitted to broker APIs (or simulated in test mode)
- [x] Stop-loss and take-profit parameters are supported
- [x] Different position sizing methods are supported (fixed, percentage, risk)
- [x] Proper error handling for all steps in the process
- [x] Comprehensive logging throughout the order processing flow

## Technical Notes
The order processing system should be implemented with a layered architecture:
1. Trade Router - Classifies and normalizes webhook data
2. Order Engine - Processes trades into orders with sizing
3. Broker Adapter - Submits orders to broker APIs

The implementation should be flexible to support different brokers in the future, with Alpaca as the initial implementation.
