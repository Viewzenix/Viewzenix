### 4. Integration Tests
| Test ID | Test Description | Steps | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|-------|-----------------|---------------|--------|-------|
| INT-001 | End-to-end Flow | 1. Create webhook in UI<br>2. Send API request to created endpoint | Request is processed and response matches expectation | Not tested | BLOCKED | Integration testing blocked by architectural gap: Backend lacks webhook configuration management endpoints needed by the frontend |

## Architectural Gaps

### 1. Webhook Configuration Management Endpoints
The frontend WebhookService has been implemented with methods for CRUD operations on webhook configurations (create, read, update, delete), but the backend only has an endpoint for receiving trading signals. To enable proper integration:

**Missing Backend Components:**
- GET /webhooks - List all webhook configurations
- GET /webhooks/{id} - Get a specific webhook configuration
- POST /webhooks - Create a new webhook configuration
- PUT /webhooks/{id} - Update a webhook configuration
- DELETE /webhooks/{id} - Delete a webhook configuration

These endpoints need to be implemented in the backend before TASK-106 (integrating frontend WebhookService with backend API) can be completed.

## Frontend Errors Found During Testing

During testing of the WebhookService integration, several React errors were observed in the developer console:

### React Rendering Errors
| Error ID | Description | Impact | Workaround |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------|
| ERR-001 | `Warning: Cannot update a component ('HotReload') while rendering a different component ('WebhookSetupPage')` | Appears during component rendering but doesn't prevent functionality | Refresh the page after operations |
| ERR-002 | `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')` | Occurs in page.tsx around line 64 when accessing webhook.id | Refresh the page to see changes |
| ERR-003 | `_services_webhook_service__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3__._webhookService.toggleWebhookActive is not a function` | Shown when toggling webhook status | None - This error is blocking the status toggle functionality |
| ERR-004 | `Error loading webhooks from localStorage: ReferenceError: localStorage is not defined` | Server-side rendering error due to browser-specific API usage | None - The error appears during SSR but functionality works client-side |

These errors indicate issues with the React component lifecycle and state management:
1. State updates are happening during render phase, which is not allowed in React
2. The webhook object is sometimes undefined when the component tries to access its properties
3. The toggleWebhookActive method isn't being properly imported or exposed
4. Browser-specific APIs (localStorage) are being accessed during server-side rendering

For ERR-001 and ERR-002, the issues appear to be UI-only and operations are correctly reflected after a page refresh, indicating that the data persistence layer is working properly. ERR-003 is a critical issue that completely prevents the webhook status toggle functionality from working, even after page refresh. ERR-004 is a server-side rendering issue that occurs because the WebhookService tries to access localStorage during server rendering, but this functionality continues to work correctly on the client side.

## Issues and Recommendations
1. UX Improvement: Make notification messages stay visible longer before disappearing to improve user experience
2. Backend Fix: Update backend configuration to use FLASK_DEBUG instead of deprecated FLASK_ENV parameter
3. Architecture Gap: Implement webhook configuration management endpoints in the backend to support frontend WebhookService functionality
4. Frontend Fix: Resolve React rendering errors in WebhookSetupPage component, particularly around state management and component updates
5. Frontend Critical Fix: Fix the toggleWebhookActive function import/reference in the webhook status toggle functionality - this is a blocker issue preventing a core feature from working
6. Frontend Improvement: Add proper error handling to ensure graceful degradation when functions are unavailable
7. Frontend Fix: Implement server-side rendering compatibility for WebhookService by checking for window/localStorage availability and using dynamic imports or the useEffect hook for browser-specific code

## Conclusion
The frontend UI components and backend webhook signal endpoint are functioning correctly when tested individually, with one critical exception: the webhook status toggle functionality is completely broken due to an implementation error.

Most React rendering errors encountered during testing don't prevent core functionality from working after a page refresh, allowing basic CRUD operations to work despite the UI issues. However, the status toggle functionality is completely non-functional due to a missing or incorrectly exported method in the WebhookService.

Full integration testing is blocked by the missing webhook configuration management endpoints in the backend. A new task should be created to implement these endpoints before proceeding with the integration task. Additionally, a critical bug fix for the webhook status toggle functionality should be prioritized, along with addressing other React rendering errors to improve the user experience and code quality.
