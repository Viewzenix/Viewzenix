### 4. Integration Tests
| Test ID | Test Description | Steps | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|-------|-----------------|---------------|--------|-------|
| INT-001 | End-to-end Flow | 1. Create webhook in UI<br>2. Send API request to created endpoint | Request is processed and response matches expectation | Not tested | BLOCKED | Integration testing blocked by architectural gap: Backend lacks webhook configuration management endpoints needed by the frontend |

## Architectural Gaps

### 1. Webhook Configuration Management Endpoints
The frontend WebhookService has been implemented with methods for CRUD operations on webhook configurations (create, read, update, delete), but the backend only has an endpoint for receiving trading signals. To enable proper integration:

**Missing Backend Components:**
- GET /webhooks - List all webhook configurations
- GET /webhooks/{id} - Get a specific webhook configuration
- POST /webhooks - Create a new webhook configuration
- PUT /webhooks/{id} - Update a webhook configuration
- DELETE /webhooks/{id} - Delete a webhook configuration

These endpoints need to be implemented in the backend before TASK-106 (integrating frontend WebhookService with backend API) can be completed.

## Issues and Recommendations
1. UX Improvement: Make notification messages stay visible longer before disappearing to improve user experience
2. Backend Fix: Update backend configuration to use FLASK_DEBUG instead of deprecated FLASK_ENV parameter
3. Architecture Gap: Implement webhook configuration management endpoints in the backend to support frontend WebhookService functionality

## Conclusion
The frontend UI components and backend webhook signal endpoint are functioning correctly when tested individually. However, full integration testing is blocked by the missing webhook configuration management endpoints in the backend. A new task should be created to implement these endpoints before proceeding with the integration task.
